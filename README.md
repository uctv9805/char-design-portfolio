## The Footer

The footer section consists of 3 sections, artists address, socail media links, and a link to the contact page.

- The address offers the user confidence that they are dealing with a professional, they have a headquarters and can be contacted.

- The social media icons are all links to the corresponding social media sights of the artist (*the twitter one just opens twitter in a new tab for now as the artist does not have a twitter acount, this could be altered later when the account is set up*). They all open in new tabs to allow the user to stay on the website for easier navigation. It offers the user another way to stay connected to the artist and alternative methods of contact as well.

- Contact section offers a link to the contact page so that no matter what page the user is on, once they are ready, there is an easy alternate navigation to contact the artist. It is underlined so the user is aware it is a link and has a hover effect so they know it is clickable.

### CSS
When testing using the official jigsaw validator using the URI some errors were raised coming directly from the bootstrap URI, not related to any of my code - I proved this by adding my CSS and ran the validator by direct input and no errros were reported in my code
